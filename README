This takes posts by developers on the official LOTRO forums and tweets them.

https://twitter.com/lotro_dev_track

This is needed because there's currently no RSS feed on the tracker, and I like
seeing them on Twitter.

Posts are from: 

  https://www.lotro.com/en/forums/post_tracker.php?tracker=devtracker

Requires Python 3 and the Tweepy module

Rename config.txt.dist to config.txt and fill in your Twitter API credentials
